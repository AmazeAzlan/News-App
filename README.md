This is a simple news application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches news articles from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and displays them on the web page. The app allows users to search for news articles based on keywords, view the latest headlines, and click on individual news articles to read more.

## Usage

To use this project, you will need to obtain an API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and paste it into the `API_KEY` variable in the JavaScript code.

```javascript
// Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual News API key
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```

Once you have replaced `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the News App.
